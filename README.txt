Crystal Collector!

Crystal Collector is a fun and interactive game for the web browser that dynamically updates the HTML pages using the jQuery library.

HOW TO PLAY

The player will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal the player will add a specific amount of points to the total score.

The player wins the game by matching the total score to the random number. The player loses the game if the total score exceeds the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from the player until clicked on.

Each time a new game starts, the values of the crystals change.
